## Assemble your robot

There is no standard way to build your prototype robot chassis, but please note:

- The chassis needs to house the Raspberry Pi, motor controller, and batteries.
- The chassis needs to allow the mounting of a pair of wheels.
- You may want to later add a couple of line sensors, and an ultrasonic distance sensor or a lidar sensor to the chassis.

It's always a good idea to build a prototype chassis first. Eventually, you can learn how to laser-cut or 3D print a chassis, but in this project, a cardboard box is used as a temporary solution.

Position your motors where you would like them to sit in your box. 

Use a pen to mark the place where each motor's axle will pass through the wall of the box. Make sure you are giving your wheels enough room to spin around.

Poke holes through the sides of the box so that the axles can fit through.

Attach the wheels to the axles.

You might want to fix the motors in place using an adhesive putty or tape to hold them down.

Screw a ball caster to the front of the container to act as a third wheel.

Power up your Raspberry Pi. 

You can use a power bank to give your robot some freedom!

If you want to make your own power bank, then follow the guide below.

To use your Raspberry Pi without connecting a mouse, monitor, or keyboard, you can remotely access it using [Raspberry Pi Connect](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-connect){:target="_blank"}.
