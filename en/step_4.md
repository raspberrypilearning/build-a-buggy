## Assemble your robot

There is no standard way to build your prototype robot chassis, but please note:

- The chassis needs to house the Raspberry Pi, motor controller, and batteries.
- The chassis needs to allow the mounting of a pair of wheels.
- You may want to later add a couple of line sensors, and an ultrasonic distance sensor or a lidar sensor to the chassis.

It's always a good idea to build a prototype chassis first. Eventually, you can learn how to laser-cut or 3D print a chassis, but in this project, a cardboard box is used as a temporary solution.

Place your motors inside the box, in roughly the position that you would like them to sit. 

Use a pen to mark the place where each motor's axle will need to pass through the walls of the box. Make sure you are giving your wheels enough room to spin around.

Use a sharp object to poke holes through the sides of the box so that the motors' axles can fit through.

If you're using a power bank, you can now power up your Raspberry Pi. If you want to make your own power bank, then follow the guide below.

To use your Raspberry Pi without connecting a mouse, monitor, or keyboard, you can remotely access it using [Raspberry Pi Connect](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-connect){:target="_blank"}.
