You can buy a kit [here](https://thepihut.com/products/camjam-edukit-3-robotics){:target="_blank"} that contains most of these electronic components, or source them yourself.

#### Basic buggy
- Raspberry Pi (any model with a pin header)
- Motor controller board
- 2 × 3V - 6V DC motors
- 2 × wheels
- 1 × AA battery holder (for 4 AA batteries)
- 4 × AA batteries
- Ball caster
- Wire or jumper leads
- USB power bank
- Screw driver
- Wire strippers
- Small cardboard or plastic box
- Adhesives (duct tape/putty/glue)
- Soldering iron and solder (if your motors' wires are not already attached)

If you are planning to add autonomous capability (self-driving) to your robot buggy, then you will need these additional optional bits:

#### Optional additional components
- Breadboard
- VL53L0X time-of-flight range finder or ultrasonic distance sensor
- 2 × line following sensors
